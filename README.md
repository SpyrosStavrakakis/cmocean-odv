cmocean colormaps for Ocean Data Viewer.

Bring beautiful oceanography colormaps into your research. There is [documentation](http://matplotlib.org/cmocean/) for the cmocean colormaps.

To use the colormaps, download the *.pal files from the `pal` directory and move them to your local copy of ODV, in the `palettes` directory. (On my Mac it is in `~/Documents/ODV/palettes`.) Once you have these files, right click on a section of data that you want colored with a different colormap, choose `Properties > General > Palette` and then you can choose one of the new colormaps from the dropdown menu.
